              - Each <Player> is an independent instance of the Player component, with its own props (`name`, `symbol`).
              - **Isolation**: Each Player manages its own state (`isEditing`) via `useState`, so editing one Player doesnâ€™t affect others.
              - **Why Reusable?** The same Player component is used for multiple players, reducing code duplication and ensuring consistent UI and logic. */}
